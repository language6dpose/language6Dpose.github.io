    <h2>üìÑ Dataset License and Restrictions</h2>
    <p>
        This dataset is rendered from 3D models obtained from <a href="https://www.turbosquid.com/" target="_blank">TurboSquid</a>. 
        Due to the licensing terms of the TurboSquid 3D Model License, we are not allowed to redistribute the original mesh files.
        The released dataset contains only rendered RGB-D images and annotated 6D poses of functional parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important:</strong> According to the TurboSquid license (Section II-6-d), 
        <strong>you may NOT use this dataset for training any machine learning model</strong> 
        without prior written authorization from TurboSquid.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to use the dataset for training or any machine learning purposes, 
        please contact TurboSquid to obtain permission by sending an email to:  
        <a href="mailto:use@turbosquid.com">use@turbosquid.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are welcome to use the dataset for visualization, evaluation, or academic discussion under appropriate non-training conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Generation Tools</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset was generated using <strong>NVIDIA Isaac Gym</strong> for physics simulation and rendering. 
        The generation scripts and simulation tools will be released soon.
    </p>

    <h2>Training Code</h2>
    <p>
        The training code for <strong>Language Embedded 6D Pose Estimation</strong> will be made publicly available in the near future.
